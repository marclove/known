After thoroughly analyzing the codebase, I've identified several potential refactoring opportunities that could improve code quality. Here are my findings:

Yes, there are several refactoring opportunities:

1. Significant Code Duplication in autostart.rs

The enable_autostart(), disable_autostart(), and is_autostart_enabled() functions contain nearly identical code for building the AutoLaunch instance. This violates the DRY principle.

Opportunity: Extract a shared function build_auto_launch() that creates the AutoLaunch instance.

2. Repeated String Constants

Multiple string constants are repeated across files:
- ".rules", ".cursor/rules", ".windsurf/rules" appear in both daemon.rs and symlinks.rs
- Error message patterns are duplicated

Opportunity: Extract these into a shared constants module or centralize them in one location.

3. Error Handling Pattern Repetition

Similar error mapping patterns appear throughout:
- Path to string conversion with UTF-8 error handling
- IO error wrapping with custom messages
- Directory canonicalization error handling

Opportunity: Create helper functions for common error handling patterns.

4. Long Functions with Multiple Responsibilities

Several functions are doing too much:
- create_agents_file_in_dir() (127 lines) handles file checking, migration logic, and directory creation
- start_daemon_with_config_no_lock() (97 lines) handles config loading, watcher setup, and event loop
- CLI command handling in main.rs has repetitive error handling patterns

Opportunity: Break these into smaller, focused functions.

5. Platform-Specific Code Duplication

Symlink creation code is duplicated:
- In create_symlinks_in_dir() lines 94-104
- In create_symlink_to_file() lines 222-231

Opportunity: Consolidate into a single platform-agnostic symlink creation function.

Recommendations:

High Priority (would provide clear benefits):
1. Extract AutoLaunch builder function - Eliminates significant duplication
2. Consolidate symlink creation - Improves maintainability
3. Extract common string constants - Reduces magic strings

Medium Priority (nice to have):
4. Break up long functions into smaller pieces
5. Create helper functions for common error patterns

These refactorings would improve maintainability, reduce bugs from inconsistent implementations, and make the code easier to understand and modify. The changes align with good Rust practices and would make the codebase more robust.
